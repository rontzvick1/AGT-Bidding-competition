AGT Competition - Student Agent Template
========================================

Team Name: [RAY]
Members: 
  - [Ron Tzvick 322293390]

  - [Ayelet Shmaya 213527237]

Strategy Description:
1. If valuation ≤ 0, budget == 0, or no rounds remain → bid 0.
2. Compute remaining rounds and budget per round.
3. If rich or panic-spending → bid ≈ valuation (or conservatively for very low values).
4. Else, bid ≈ valuation if current value ≥ average future value; otherwise bid conservatively.
5. In the last rounds, override to bid more aggressively.
6. Cap bid at valuation and remaining budget.

Key Features:
- Bet aggressively on high-value items when budget allows
- Try to make other bidders exhaust their budgets
- Final rounds: go all-in if budget remains
- Look at the average of remaining valuations to decide bid level
